## Description

This is a boilerplater setup for a simple blog. The stack is GatsbyJS and Contentful. GatsbyJS is a static site generator which uses React. Contentful is a headless content management system (CMS).

## Setup


Latest Node installed. It is a good idea to use NVM but not mandatory.

`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

`npm install --global surge`

`npm install`

Create a free account at [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/get-started/).

Then in your space create a content model called BlogPost. This field will need 4 fields to start with.

- title - Will be the title of the post
- slug - Name for the route to be used on the site(should not contain white space)
- createdDate - It's a date :). Needed to sort blog post. 
- postBody - The post it self. Should be set up as "long text" and Appearence should be set to Markdown

Then go to Settings -> API keys -> Copy both Space ID and Content Delivery API - access token. 

Create a file called `.env` 

Add the following:

CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID='YOUR-PERSONAL-SPACE-ID'

CONTENTFUL_DELIVER_API_TOKEN='YOUR-PERSONAL-DELIVERY-TOKEN'

Now create a real blog post!

## Running the project

cmd: gatsby develop

-> Will start the devserver with HMR and GraphQL playouground.

You can reach your site at: http://localhost:8000

You can reach your GraphQl playground at: http://localhost:8000/___graphql

## üí´ Deploy

We will deploy the blog to Surge.sh. In order to do so we will first run gatsby build which will put the static site under /public. Navigate in your terminal to the public folder.

Watch this [mini-tutorial](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge)

So when standing in /public run the command surge. Enter your information and give your domain a name. After completing the setup the surge-cli tool will make your site live. Now send a mail to your mom, tell her you have quit your job as an IT-consultant in order to become a full time influencer. 

## Further assigments


So now we have something running. But in order to get to know the stack better I have some assignments waiting.


# Contentful


- Update your content model with a list field. You have decided that you want to list a couple of links at the bottom of every blog post. When doing this you will have to make changes in the blog-post template, the gatsby-node build step and the model in contentful. Start with the model and use the GraphQl playground in order to see what you can query.

- The contentful plugin has the ability to cache content and assets. This means that you can still build your project without having a network connection. Perhaps not the latest content but perfect for the days when you are stuck in a train deep beneath the earth. Before the Battle Royal starts you can always get some work done. Look att the documentation and try it out for your self. [DOCS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/)

- Right now you are getting published content. Look at the docs of the gatsby-source-contentful plugin and switch to the preview API! [DOCS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/)


# Styling

- Does your blog look boring. GatsbyJs has suport for different CSS approaches. Read more in the [DOCS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/styling/). Then style your blog!


# Gatsby

- If you want to be a world class inluencer you have got to work with SEO. Add some basic SEO by follwing this [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/).

- Sourcing from the local filesystem. Right now we are using data from Contentful, if one would like to use markdown files that resides locally follow this [guide](). 

# Working with images

So GatsbyJS and contentful has a lot of options when working with images. Add an image to every blog post and render it in the blog-post template.

To do this you will have to add an image to your Contentful Space Assets.

You will have to read the Gatsby [docs]() for using images.

You will have to update the GraphQl queries and the template view.

_This is the assignment which will take the longest time to complete. One suggestion would be to start with the first Contentful assignment._

## Final words

The Gatsby site has a lot of documentation. This workshop has been based on something called a _starter_. There are many more starters available. The _starters_ are mini repos designed for you to get up to speed quickly.  so if blogging is not your thing take a looke here.

Gatsby har a lot of plugins for handling various things. Take a look at the [marketplace](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?).

You can also create your own plugin if you think that something can be solved in a better way. Take a look at plugin [marketplace](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/).

## Description of folder and files that GatsbyJS uses:

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
